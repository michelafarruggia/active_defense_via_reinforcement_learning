The features of the implemented Reward Machine are heavily based on those implemented in the project https://github.com/RodrigoToroIcarte/reward_machines/tree/master. The code in the 'reward_machines' folder comes from this project, with modifications to the rm_environment.py file to adapt it to our reward machine.
